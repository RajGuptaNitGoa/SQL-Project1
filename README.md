# Pizza Sales Data Analysis

## Project Description

This project involves the analysis of a pizza sales dataset using SQL queries. The dataset consists of four CSV files: `order_details`, `orders`, `pizza_types`, and `pizzas`. The analysis aims to extract valuable insights about the pizza sales, including basic, intermediate, and advanced SQL queries to explore various aspects of the data.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following files:

- `order_details.csv`: Contains details of each order, including order ID, pizza ID, quantity, and other relevant information.
- `orders.csv`: Contains information about each order, such as order ID, date, time, and customer details.
- `pizza_types.csv`: Contains information about different types of pizzas, including pizza ID, name, and category.
- `pizzas.csv`: Contains information about pizzas, including pizza ID, name, size, and price.

## SQL Queries

### Basic Queries
1. Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
2. Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
3. Identify the highest-priced pizza.
4. Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
5. List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.

### Intermediate Queries
1. Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
2. Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
3. Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
4. Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
5. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

### Advanced Queries
1. Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
2. Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.
3. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.
